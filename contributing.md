To add a new project to the collection, please ensure they meet the following requirements arranged in order of importance

* The project must be **made in Nigeria** as the name implies :grin:.

* The project must be open source.

* The project must have global use - meaning it's not made just for use by Nigerians and there really is no geographical limitation for anyone that may be interested in using this project.

* The project should have at least 10 stars. This is to serve as a way to determine that people actually have a use for the project and it does what it says it does. [ Stars likely to go up as time goes on :smiley: ].

* The project should not be a list of some sort.

* Ensure to provide a social media url of the creator of the project outside GitHub.

* Try to add the project to it's appropriate alphabetical location.

* You might want to include the **made in Nigeria** badge to your project. Place the following code in your **README** file:
`[![Made in Nigeria](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20in-nigeria-008751.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/acekyd/made-in-nigeria)`
